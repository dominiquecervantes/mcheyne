The M'Cheyne Bible Reading Plan is a popular Bible reading plan choice that was created by 19th Century Scottish minister, Robert Murray M'Cheyne. 
The plan takes you through the Bible in one year (Old Testament once, and the New Testament and Psalms twice in one year).
Dominique's M'Cheyne app consumes the ESV API (documentation can be found at https://api.esv.org/)
This app will also offer a pdf from https://static.crossway.org/excerpt/3-esv-mcheyne-reading-plan.4.pdf

I hope to offer other features in the future.
